# Have Fun and Learn Kotlin!

Exercises to learn Kotlin a test at a time

Used the first time at London Workshop Day for Kotlin: The Server Side Workshop on 28th of July 2018

https://medium.com/@ramtop/have-fun-and-learn-kotlin-25daa2e366c0


# Instructions:

1) clone/fork the repository

2) ./gradlew build (it should download dependency, compile and then fail with the first test)

3) fix the tests starting from the intro01 package and going in order
 - all tests must pass
 - you can change any line in the test but not the assertions
 - follow the guidelines in the comment
 - enjoy experimenting with the language

4) try the functional kata exercises after the intro

5) tweet me at @ramtop when finished! :)

Any feedback is welcome.
